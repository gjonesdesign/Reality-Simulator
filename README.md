# Reality Simulator
This program simulates a continious day/ night cycle with changing weather. As the day changes, the sky changes and the sun sets/ stars emerge. Every new day the weather changes based loosly on the previous day's weather. This includes clouds, rain, and wind strength. Wind also effects the movement of the clouds and rain, as well as the trees and grass. The grass grows slowly, increasing in growth on rainy days.

## SIGNIFICANCE
This program is a fun look at exploring real world processees in code. Last year I found it interesting to consider what it would be like to simulate reality in processing and placed that into the context of a short animation. This project is sort of a spiritial sucessor, in that we actually attempt to simulate something from world. 

## INSTRUCTIONS  
Simply run the code and it will cycle through the days and weather. Because grass can only grow so high, I have placed a limit on how high grass can grow. Thus, if you wish to see the grass growing again but it has already reached max height, pressing the space bar will trim the grass back to the base giving it space to grow again. Enjoy.

## INITIAL CONCEPTS
This project originally was focused on creating a mask that used seperate peices of the webcam input to either distort, duplicate, or censor parts of the face. These early concepts looked as such:
